			<h2>About: </h2>
			<h4>Watson is a cognitive technology that processes information more like a human than a computer; by understanding natural language, generating hypothesis based on evidence, and learning as it goes. And learn it does. Watson "gets smarter" in three ways: by being taught by its users (via dynamic learning), by learning from prior interactions (via hypotheses generation), and by being presented with new information (via language).</h4>
			<h4>To highlight some of Watson's features, we've trained Watson to be a financial advisor</h4>
			<br>
			<p><b>Technologies used: </b> HTML/CSS, Java, jQuery, underscoreJS, requireJS, Javascript</p>
			<p><b>Environment: </b> Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers,  Amazon Web Services (EC2)</p>

			<p>Here, we can select a question for Watson to answer or we can type it in our search bar in the middle of the screen</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="block">
			<img src="img/projects/watson/5.png"/>
			<p>Now, Watson can give you a response it thinks is best suited for your particular question</p>

			<p>Watson, by default, will give you its most confident answer, but if you don't think the answer is answering you question correctly, you can choose from other answers Watson thought might be relevant. If your desired answer is in one of those suggestions, please select it. Watson will learn from this!</p>

			<p>Finally, when you're done with your session, Watson will give you a summary and will compare that with other searches to show you an overview.</p>
