			<h3>Watson Demo Web Application</h3>
			<h4>Client: International Business Machines (IBM), New York, NY</h4>
			<p>Watson is a cognitive technology that processes information more like a human than a computer; by understanding natural language, generating hypothesis based on evidence, and learning as it goes. And learn it does. Watson “gets smarter” in three ways: by being taught by its users (via dynamic learning), by learning from prior interactions (via hypotheses generation), and by being presented with new information (via language).</p>
